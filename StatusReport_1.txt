TEAM 16: STATUS REPORT 1

1. What we accomplished during the week:

        Ability to live scan a barcode using QuaggaJS Barcode Scanner API.

        Option to upload a file from a device for static barcode scanning as
        well as the option to preview this file before submission.

        File created sending ingredients list to spoonacular API and returning 
        recipe list.

        Began working on MongoDB.

2. Challenges and issues faced during the week:

        Laptop crashed with weird question mark folder appearing.

        Spoonacular file will be pushed when laptop is returned.

3. Goals for next week:

        Continue to work on MongoDB and begin work on decoder.

        We are also hoping that Patti Klos from Tufts Dining will reply to our 
        email requesting TUFTS API. Need access to barcodes of items in either
        Dewick or Hodgdon. If for some reason we do not receive this, we can 
        use UPCdatabase API for example barcodes instead.

        Work on barcode decoder portion using QuaggaJS API. Be able to receive
        image of barcode from both a file and from a camera.

        Preference back camera to scan barcode if device has two cameras.

        Ability to upload multiple barcode files at once.
